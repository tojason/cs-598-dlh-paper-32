# Data download instruction
The filtered data of MIMIC-III is `dataset/t1` folder. We only use a subset of MIMIC-III and it is filtered based on the requirement in the paper. This subset of MIMIC-III is already decoded that does not contains any original information from the original MIMIC-III.

The file 'Extract MIMIC III Dataset.ipynb` contains code to extract patient information from the raw MIMIC III Dataset.
